## Usage

In __System > Configuration > Catalog > Catalog > Price__, this extension adds a new option: __Price Precision__

![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-4lObp8MYMhE/UIFNsM6d5ZI/AAAAAAAALM8/_5qEZsH0Q4k/s1600/precision.png)

* Set "2" (default value) to stay with the Magento basic behavior
* Set a different value between 0 and 4 to change the price precision. 0 means no decimals will be displayed.

__Avoiding side effect:__

If __Price Precision__ is changed in __default scope__, it will affect __admininstration area__ in some ways. For instance, in __Sales > Orders__ management, __Order Totals section__ will be affected.

To avoid this behavior, let __Price Precision__ unchanged (value = "2") in __default scope __and change its value in __website scope__, for each website you have (or in __"store view" scope__ if needed).

__Incomplete case:__

On product detail page of a configurable product, there are drop-down lists (one per attribute), to choose product options. Some options may vary the final price. In this case, the price difference is written into the option label (e.g.: +â‚¬50.00 or -$20.00). For these prices, the number of decimals is hard-coded in configurable.js and product.js files. This case is not managed by this extension.
